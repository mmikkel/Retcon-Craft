# Retcon Changelog

## 2.7.3 - 2023-08-01

### Fixed  

- Fixed a regression introduced in Retcon 2.7.0, where Retcon would return unparsed reference tags from Redactor/CKEditor output, in cases where there were no nodes matching the given selector.   

## 2.7.2 - 2023-07-30

### Fixed

- Fixed a regression introduced in Retcon 2.7.0, where Imager/Imager X would fail to transform external images, if the image URL contained a query string or was missing a file extension

## 2.7.1 - 2023-07-23 

### Fixed

- Fixed a PHP exception that could occur if Retcon operated on markup containing `<svg>` nodes  
- Fixed an issue where the `retconRemoveEmpty` filter could remove `<svg>`, `<iframe>` and `<object>` tags 

### Changed

- Retcon now requires `symfony/dom-crawler` v. 4.4.0 or later  
- Retcon now requires `symfony/css-selector` v. 3.4.0 or later  
- Retcon now requires `masterminds/html5` v. 2.6.0 or later  

## 2.7.0.1 - 2023-07-23

### Fixed

- Fixed a regression introduced in 2.7.0, that could remove text content from nodes returned by the `retconOnly` filter

## 2.7.0 - 2023-07-22

### Added

- Added a new `retconDimensions` filter, which can be used to set missing `width` and `height` attributes for image
  nodes.
- Added a new `$allowFilenameAsAltText` parameter to the `retconAutoAlt` filter (default `true`; will be default `false`
  in Retcon 3.0).
- Added `RetconTransformedImage` model.

### Improved

- Improved support for CKEditor.

### Changed

- The `autoAlt` filter now uses the native `alt` attribute if it has a value (Craft 4 only).
- When using Imager (X) to transform images, the `retconTransform` and `retconSrcset` filters now respect
  Imager's [`safeFileFormats`](https://imager-x.spacecat.ninja/configuration.html#safefileformats-array) configuration
  setting, i.e. these filters will only attempt to transform jpgs, gifs and pngs out of the box, unless additional
  formats have been added in Imager's config file.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the `retconRemoveEmpty` filter would remove self-closing tags.
- Fixed an issue where DOMDocument could wrap text nodes in `<p>` tags.
- Fixed an issue where the `retconUnwrap` filter could unwrap root nodes.
- Fixed an issue where the `autoAlt` filter was unable to retrieve alt value from the source asset.
- Fixed an issue where the `retconAutoAlt` filter could use base64 `src` placeholders could be used for the alt value.
- Fixed a PHP exception that would occur if using `retconTransform` or `retconSrcset` with Imager X named transforms, if
  the named transform consisted of multiple transforms. Retcon will now use the first transform whenever Imager returns
  multiple transforms.
- Fixed an issue where the `retconTransform` and `retconSrcset` filters could upscale images even if
  Craft's `upscaleImages` setting was set to `false`.

## 2.6.1 - 2023-02-17

- Fixed a PHP exception that could occur when Retcon was unable to get the dimensions for an image being transformed
- Fixed a bug where the `retconTransform` filter would not apply missing `width` and `height` attributes to the `img`

  Retcon is able to read out the dimensions

### Changed

- The `selector`, `sizes`, `base64src`, `className`, `attributeName`, `imagerTransformDefaults`
